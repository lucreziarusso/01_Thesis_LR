          <h1>Introduction: let's see what happens if the title is long</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="twoCol">
          Over the last three decades, the exponential development of technology has impacted all creative practices
          and
          has radically changed graphic design perspectives. The revolution brought about by the rise of the personal
          computer, particularly the release of the first Macintosh in 1984, created new opportunities for graphic
          design
          research and production, opening the path to methodological and esthetical experimentations. Nevertheless, the
          transition between the two centuries marked a pivot and revealed the exhaustion of that momentum, which
          mutated
          into a manifest crisis of creative methodologies. Companies like Apple, Adobe, and, years later, Google have
          been the driving force behind the technological revolution in design. However, in their effort to provide
          access
          to easy-to-use computers, interfaces, and tools, they have participated in the standardization of design
          esthetics, and fostered the commodification of design culture instead of its democratization.<br>
          In 2012, Kevin Donnot published the article “Code = design,” <span class="fnnum">[1]</span> an excerpt of his
          master’s thesis “Outils
          numériques et design graphique” (Digital Tools and Graphic Design). The essay questions the tools largely
          employed in the graphic design practice and, by extension, the practice itself. Restrained by the limitations
          of
          the massified software and submitted to the monopolization of devices that occurred in the early 2000s, the
          graphic designer must reclaim, Donnot stated, his status as a craftsperson and reappropriate the tools of
          creation. <span class="fnnum">[2]</span> Indeed, the standardization of the tools would translate to a
          normalization of graphic production and
          its esthetic. <span class="fnnum">[3]</span> To foster originality the graphic designer must become the maker
          of the creative tools.
          Programming and free software seem a possible alternative to reclaim this active role: “The interest of the
          free
          software [is that] the designer can integrate new functions and, above all, understand how the software works.
          Then, s/he is not lowered to a role of ‘user’ or ‘consumer’ and condemned to technical passivity. S/he moves
          from the status of consumer to the one of creator.” <span class="fnnum">[4]</span>
          Ten years after its release, Donnot mentioned Processing as being one of the programming languages and
          environments, within the free software movement, which represented an interesting alternative for graphic
          design: “The software proposes a new space for visual experimentation where the design is controlled by code.
          […] This alternative approach implies alternative creative processes and, therefore, alternative graphical
          propositions.” <span class="fnnum">[5]</span> Finally, Processing had crossed the Atlantic and was recognized
          as ambassador of the free and
          open source software movement, and as legitimate tool for the graphic design practice.<br><br>

          Conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Casey Reas and Ben Fry and built on the
          shoulders of prestigious predecessors such as Muriel Cooper and John Maeda, the first version of Processing
          was
          released in 2001. An easy-to-use, accessible coding language and programming environment, Processing was
          created
          to provide an educational tool for learning the graphic design principles, such as color and composition,
          through the medium of computation. <span class="fnnum">[6]</span> Intended for artists and designers, Reas and
          Fry’s proposition fostered the
          idea of “learning to create software” as opposed to “learning to use software,” suggesting a practical
          solution
          to the crisis of design methodologies of the late 1990s. <span class="fnnum">[7]</span> From the onset,
          Processing was quickly adopted by
          professionals who embraced its potential as a modular, expandable, and customizable kit. <span
            class="fnnum">[8]</span> Its auto-productive
          methodology echoed Do It Yourself (DIY) and hackers’ approaches and it opened the path to a renewal of the
          crafts in the design practice, resulting in a hybridization of analog and digital methods of productions.<br>
          Nevertheless, the core idea of Processing is even more radical, and its moral extent that “emerged within the
          culture of free software” <span class="fnnum">[9]</span> defines its approach and “differentiates [it] from
          proprietary, consumer-driven
          software.” Processing stands alongside the free/libre and open source software ideology and promotes the ideas
          of freedom and accessibility as essential. This position distances the project from purely esthetic
          considerations, adding a moral dimension in extending methodology to ideology. In the last decade, a community
          has grown. The work done by the community has provided new meanings to the expression “open source,” and has
          fostered a new vision of shared and decentralized collaboration, in fields that not only deal with software
          development.<br><br>

          Within this context, this thesis investigates, through the prism of graphic design, how Processing and the
          community built around it have transformed the design field and influenced the current generation of
          designers.
          Providing new perspectives to expand creativity and stand against the normalization of design imposed by
          design
          monopolies, Processing can be considered a pivot, this research postulates, in the dialectic opposition
          between
          the free open source and the start-up cultures, both interlaced within the graphic design field.
          The first chapter defines and contextualizes the opposition between start-up and free open source cultures,
          which arose in Silicon Valley and MIT between the 1970s and the beginning of the new century. The analysis of
          cases such as Apple Computer, Adobe Systems, and Google Design exemplifies the paradox of the start-up model,
          highlighting its metamorphosis from a counterculture into a monopoly. The review of core texts by the leading
          actors of the hacker, free software, and open source movements clarifies the misconception of free and open
          source culture and recognizes Processing as an advocate for a free and decentralized approach.
          The second part of this research focuses on Processing and the community developed around it over the last
          twenty years. From Muriel Cooper and John Maeda to Casey Reas and Ben Fry, this chapter first describes
          Processing’s origins at MIT. By analyzing the platform’s main components—language, environment, community—the
          chapter examines how Processing has expanded the concept of accessibility, questioning its economic, social,
          and
          political aspects, and has fostered values of inclusion as a critical part of the project.
          Finally, this research describes in its third chapter how the free open source culture and the system of
          values
          fostered by Processing influenced contemporary designers, contributing to the emergence of new patterns in the
          graphic design field. Through the reappropriation of the creative tools, contemporary designers distance their
          productions from standardized esthetics and reveal alternative methodologies that encompass values of
          accessibility and inclusion as a central part of their work. These methodologies, including the hybridization
          of
          production tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory generative design, and the use of cyberspace as a
          free
          framework, are valid propositions for a practice renewal based on responsibility and flexibility.
          To solve the perpetual struggle of graphic designers’ position, often tugged between radical polarities—design
          research on one side and design industry on the other—this thesis highlights alternative perspectives
          encompassing the acceptance of the profession’s paradox and the awareness of the designers’ responsibility in
          contemporary society.

        <div class="oneCol">
          <h1> 1. Start-up vs. Free Open Source: Contrasting Cultures</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="twoCol">
          Graphic Design history cannot be dissociated from the technological evolution of tools: from the invention of
          the movable-type printing press, that shaped a new relationship to alphabets and, therefore, to typography,
          till
          the creation of the offset printing or the photocopy machine, which liberated the production and distribution
          of
          artist books and fanzines, new design esthetics and methodologies have always been empowered by new
          technological devices.
          Computational machines, the precursors of personal computers, joined the list of tools that have informed and
          reformed the way artists and designers conceived and produced images. By the 1970s, we observed a rising
          interest in merging art and mathematics through the medium of computation. Artists such as Vera Molnár,
          Manfred
          Mohr, and Frieder Nake pioneered the exploration of algorithmic thinking as a practical methodology for the
          arts. In a recent interview, Vera Molnár reiterated her approach: “In order to detect this extraordinary
          moment
          when the art arises, we do not have enough time and strength to craft it. It would mean to make millions and
          billions of variations. […] Here, you have a slave that follows your wishes. [The computer] allows you to
          materialize very quickly your visual thoughts which you could not have created because of lack of time or
          strength, or visual acuteness.” Working with computation, Molnár pursued a part of the research developed by
          artists like Sol Lewitt, based on conceiving instructions to create a work of art. Giving instructions to the
          machine through code and randomizing some variables, she was, therefore, expanding intuition and enriching her
          senses: “There is a thing that can replace intuition. It’s randomness. Because […] it will show you billions
          of
          possibilities of which, with your limited imagination, you could not have thought of.”
          The concept of expanding the potential of creation, using computers and code, is not limited to this radical
          artistic research. Mirroring the niche of computational art, the graphic design scene of central Europe of the
          1960s developed design research that explored the potential of computation. Karl Gerstner, a prominent figure
          of the Swiss graphic design scene of post-WWII, was one of the first graphic designers who foresaw the
          opportunities brought by computers for a rational and functional graphic design production. In 1963, he
          published Designing Programmes, in which he compiled his efforts for automatizing processes and applying
          scientific methodologies to design. The designer needed a set of rules to select and arrange the different
          design components (typography, images, color). The computer could help create systems that enlarge the range
          of solutions, within which the designer could identify the best one.
          If the work of Gerstner or Molnár was situated at a time when computational machines were essentially
          accessible for scientific or military research, the release of the first Macintosh in 1984 was a pivot towards
          the extension of access to computers for graphic designers, and, in the following years, for a bigger
          audience.
          The American graphic designer April Greiman—who did part of her studies in Basel in the 1970s and was immersed
          in the swiss graphic design approach—was one of the first designers to openly embrace the opportunities
          created by the Macintosh. Interviewed by the magazine Emigre in 1988, she echoed Vera Molnár: “What I
          experience is rather than just doing something quickly, we’re looking at more possibilities. Instead of doing
          more work, we are seeing more options. […] With the Mac, once the information is stored, you can just look at
          seventy-two thousand variations. And then the accidents happen, and you say, ‘Oh that’s so much better, why
          don’t you go that way?’”
          The iteration of graphic results offered by the machine was promoted as a sustainable methodology for design.
          Furthermore, Greiman adopted the esthetical language of the computer as a new opportunity for graphic design
          expression: the pixel, the raster of the screen, transparency and superposition, as well as the simultaneous
          presence of visual elements became core elements of her production. These new esthetics could, according to
          Greiman, empower personal and collective manifestation: “Everybody is visual; it’s in the collective soul, and
          the Mac will empower and help a lot of these people to express themselves. I like the idea that so many people
          will have a common language […] And this tool has its own language!”
          Despite this optimistic vision, we witnessed, starting the mid-1990s, a slow but consistent shift towards a
          different use of the computer. If it was true that in the late 1980s computers were considered tools submitted
          to human beings to expand perception and production, during the following decade this trend faded away. In the
          early 2000s, it resulted in the massification of visual language’s esthetics due to a standardization of the
          tools and, therefore, of the graphic design practice.
          So, what happened between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 2000s? What were the reasons for the
          shift of the graphic design practice towards standardized methodologies? Radical design research based on the
          exploration of computer depth through the medium of computation was still pursued in institutions such as MIT.
          Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the professional graphic design field was deeply impacted by the rise of the
          “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get” (WYSIWYG) interfaces that became popular as a way of emancipating oneself from
          the required understanding of the machine to be able to make design, allowing a more intuitive approach to
          graphic composition. Two opposite approaches developed in parallel and drew the main characteristics of what
          this thesis has defined as “start-up and free open source cultures.” In the following sections, we clarify
          their origins and highlight their radical opposition that resulted, at the very beginning of twenty-first
          century, with the birth of Processing.

          <h2>1.1 From Counterculture to Monopoly: A Silicon Valley Story</h2>
          Narrowing down the geographical context in which the technological evolution of the end of the twentieth
          century occurred, we observe that devices and programs massively employed, on a worldwide scale, for graphic
          design production were created in the Silicon Valley. The binomial Apple Computer and Adobe Systems
          intersected in this economic region located in Northern California in the United States. This region, pervaded
          by the “Californian Ideology,” represented the biggest cultural paradox of modern history, and the
          contemporary design’s culture has been molded mirroring this paradox.

          <br><br>

          <p class="quote">The Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and
            the
            entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies. This amalgamation of opposites has been achieved through a profound
            faith
            in the emancipatory potential of the new information technologies. In the digital utopia, everybody will be
            both hip and rich. Not surprisingly, this optimistic vision of the future has been enthusiastically embraced
            by computer nerds, slacker students, innovative capitalists, social activists, trendy academics, futurist
            bureaucrats and opportunistic politicians across the USA.
          </p>

          <br><br>

          In the transition from the Industrial into the Knowledge Age, cyberspace, the internet, and computers were
          seen as tools for emancipation from the established power and hierarchy. Colonizing this new immaterial
          space
          is an exciting opportunity for freedom and liberation. The Californian counterculture of the 1960s was
          reshaped, during the following decades, into a paradoxical ideology connecting two opposite but equally
          powerful aspirations: the collective adventure enabled by the new reach of global communications and a
          complete professional autonomy thriving on personal success. Marshall McLuhan’s global village theory and
          the
          libertarianism promoted by Ayn Rand’s allegories were hybridized in the start-up culture which, in the name
          of
          innovation, does not perceive, or refuse to admit, the discrepancies of its economic model.
          Between the 1980s and the end of the twentieth century, cyberspace is still a place where market regulations
          are inapplicable or unapplied. Therefore, we witnessed the surge of contrasting visions for the possible
          missions of the internet. The philosophy of the free exchange of knowledge—brought about by activists such
          as
          Aaron Swartz—which fosters openness and collaboration, sets aside the liberal ideal of the conquest of
          cyberspace as a new market, denying any empathy or collaborative spirit, and promoting one’s personal
          success
          at any price.
          The aftermath of this paradoxical conjunction was the advent of start-ups companies born as opponents of
          powerful economic giants that have metamorphosized into giant infrastructures. Apple Computer and Adobe
          Systems—companies hardly avoidable in the professional graphic design field—are striking examples. Both
          corporations initially thriving for innovation with the mission of offering technological autonomy to their
          customers, have progressively been transformed into market dominators, forbidding any emancipation from
          their
          products.


          <h3>1.1.1 Apple Computer</h3>
          Invited by the TV show The Computer Chronicles, “icon designer” Susan Kare and Product Design Manager Jerry
          Manock presented, in 1985, the newly released Apple computer. Ergonomically studied to be light, portable,
          and
          user-friendly, the Macintosh was designed to be used by the “99th percentile of males, females, and
          children,”
          Maddock stated. Developed to allow comprehensive accessibility, the interface system and icons were created
          to
          be clearly and quickly understood and assimilated. Susan Kare shared during the interview that “one of the
          best experiences,” was how to easily teach in roughly twenty minutes to use the Macintosh to those who have
          never used a computer before. This was made possible because the function of each icon does not need
          additional verbal explanation. Interface and object’s ergonomics translated into reality what Steve Jobs
          foresaw few years earlier: “bringing computers to the people, with the cheerful but affordable design of an
          Eichler home and the ease of use of a sleek kitchen appliance.”
          It is paramount to remember that, considering the historical and geographical context in which the Macintosh
          was conceived, its design was inherently western centered. With its focus positioned on the wealthy
          majority,
          Apple partially ignored any inclusive design principle devoted to minorities or “special people,”
          fundamentals
          outlined, a few years later, by Don Norman in his The Design of Everyday Things. Nevertheless,
          “accessibility”
          and “affordability” were at the center of Apple’s communication. The seeds of Apple’s worldwide triumph of
          the
          following decades were grounded in these few concepts, as well as its paradox.
          Describing the interface, Susan Kare highlighted the similarities between Macintosh icons and daily life
          objects: the interface mimicked the interactions with our surroundings. We could easily recognize a
          “document”
          that we organized in a “folder.” If we saw clock hands turning, we could understand that we had to wait for
          time to pass. We calculated simple operations with a pocket calculator, and we put it in the trash can
          documents that we wanted to throw away.
