          <h1>Introduction</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="twoCol">
          Over the last three decades, the exponential development of technology has impacted all creative practices
          and
          has radically changed graphic design perspectives. The revolution brought about by the rise of the personal
          computer, particularly the release of the first Macintosh in 1984, created new opportunities for graphic
          design
          research and production, opening the path to methodological and esthetical experimentations. Nevertheless, the
          transition between the two centuries marked a pivot and revealed the exhaustion of that momentum, which
          mutated
          into a manifest crisis of creative methodologies. Companies like Apple, Adobe, and, years later, Google have
          been the driving force behind the technological revolution in design. However, in their effort to provide
          access
          to easy-to-use computers, interfaces, and tools, they have participated in the standardization of design
          esthetics, and fostered the commodification of design culture instead of its democratization.<br>
          In 2012, Kevin Donnot published the article “Code = design,” <span class="fnnum">[1]</span> an excerpt of his
          master’s thesis “Outils
          numériques et design graphique” (Digital Tools and Graphic Design). The essay questions the tools largely
          employed in the graphic design practice and, by extension, the practice itself. Restrained by the limitations
          of
          the massified software and submitted to the monopolization of devices that occurred in the early 2000s, the
          graphic designer must reclaim, Donnot stated, his status as a craftsperson and reappropriate the tools of
          creation. <span class="fnnum">[2]</span> Indeed, the standardization of the tools would translate to a
          normalization of graphic production and
          its esthetic. <span class="fnnum">[3]</span> To foster originality the graphic designer must become the maker
          of the creative tools.
          Programming and free software seem a possible alternative to reclaim this active role: “The interest of the
          free
          software [is that] the designer can integrate new functions and, above all, understand how the software works.
          Then, s/he is not lowered to a role of ‘user’ or ‘consumer’ and condemned to technical passivity. S/he moves
          from the status of consumer to the one of creator.” <span class="fnnum">[4]</span>
          Ten years after its release, Donnot mentioned Processing as being one of the programming languages and
          environments, within the free software movement, which represented an interesting alternative for graphic
          design: “The software proposes a new space for visual experimentation where the design is controlled by code.
          […] This alternative approach implies alternative creative processes and, therefore, alternative graphical
          propositions.” <span class="fnnum">[5]</span> Finally, Processing had crossed the Atlantic and was recognized
          as ambassador of the free and
          open source software movement, and as legitimate tool for the graphic design practice.<br><br>

          Conceived at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by Casey Reas and Ben Fry and built on the
          shoulders of prestigious predecessors such as Muriel Cooper and John Maeda, the first version of Processing
          was
          released in 2001. An easy-to-use, accessible coding language and programming environment, Processing was
          created
          to provide an educational tool for learning the graphic design principles, such as color and composition,
          through the medium of computation. <span class="fnnum">[6]</span> Intended for artists and designers, Reas and
          Fry’s proposition fostered the
          idea of “learning to create software” as opposed to “learning to use software,” suggesting a practical
          solution
          to the crisis of design methodologies of the late 1990s. <span class="fnnum">[7]</span> From the onset,
          Processing was quickly adopted by
          professionals who embraced its potential as a modular, expandable, and customizable kit. <span
            class="fnnum">[8]</span> Its auto-productive
          methodology echoed Do It Yourself (DIY) and hackers’ approaches and it opened the path to a renewal of the
          crafts in the design practice, resulting in a hybridization of analog and digital methods of productions.<br>
          Nevertheless, the core idea of Processing is even more radical, and its moral extent that “emerged within the
          culture of free software” <span class="fnnum">[9]</span> defines its approach and “differentiates [it] from
          proprietary, consumer-driven
          software.” Processing stands alongside the free/libre and open source software ideology and promotes the ideas
          of freedom and accessibility as essential. This position distances the project from purely esthetic
          considerations, adding a moral dimension in extending methodology to ideology. In the last decade, a community
          has grown. The work done by the community has provided new meanings to the expression “open source,” and has
          fostered a new vision of shared and decentralized collaboration, in fields that not only deal with software
          development.<br><br>

          Within this context, this thesis investigates, through the prism of graphic design, how Processing and the
          community built around it have transformed the design field and influenced the current generation of
          designers.
          Providing new perspectives to expand creativity and stand against the normalization of design imposed by
          design
          monopolies, Processing can be considered a pivot, this research postulates, in the dialectic opposition
          between
          the free open source and the start-up cultures, both interlaced within the graphic design field.
          The first chapter defines and contextualizes the opposition between start-up and free open source cultures,
          which arose in Silicon Valley and MIT between the 1970s and the beginning of the new century. The analysis of
          cases such as Apple Computer, Adobe Systems, and Google Design exemplifies the paradox of the start-up model,
          highlighting its metamorphosis from a counterculture into a monopoly. The review of core texts by the leading
          actors of the hacker, free software, and open source movements clarifies the misconception of free and open
          source culture and recognizes Processing as an advocate for a free and decentralized approach.
          The second part of this research focuses on Processing and the community developed around it over the last
          twenty years. From Muriel Cooper and John Maeda to Casey Reas and Ben Fry, this chapter first describes
          Processing’s origins at MIT. By analyzing the platform’s main components—language, environment, community—the
          chapter examines how Processing has expanded the concept of accessibility, questioning its economic, social,
          and
          political aspects, and has fostered values of inclusion as a critical part of the project.
          Finally, this research describes in its third chapter how the free open source culture and the system of
          values
          fostered by Processing influenced contemporary designers, contributing to the emergence of new patterns in the
          graphic design field. Through the reappropriation of the creative tools, contemporary designers distance their
          productions from standardized esthetics and reveal alternative methodologies that encompass values of
          accessibility and inclusion as a central part of their work. These methodologies, including the hybridization
          of
          production tools, DIY distribution methods, participatory generative design, and the use of cyberspace as a
          free
          framework, are valid propositions for a practice renewal based on responsibility and flexibility.
          To solve the perpetual struggle of graphic designers’ position, often tugged between radical polarities—design
          research on one side and design industry on the other—this thesis highlights alternative perspectives
          encompassing the acceptance of the profession’s paradox and the awareness of the designers’ responsibility in
          contemporary society.

          <h1> 1. Start-up vs. Free Open Source: Contrasting Cultures</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="twoCol">
          Graphic Design history cannot be dissociated from the technological evolution of tools: from the invention of
          the movable-type printing press, that shaped a new relationship to alphabets and, therefore, to typography,
          till
          the creation of the offset printing or the photocopy machine, which liberated the production and distribution
          of
          artist books and fanzines, new design esthetics and methodologies have always been empowered by new
          technological devices.
          Computational machines, the precursors of personal computers, joined the list of tools that have informed and
          reformed the way artists and designers conceived and produced images. By the 1970s, we observed a rising
          interest in merging art and mathematics through the medium of computation. Artists such as Vera Molnár,
          Manfred
          Mohr, and Frieder Nake pioneered the exploration of algorithmic thinking as a practical methodology for the
          arts. In a recent interview, Vera Molnár reiterated her approach: “In order to detect this extraordinary
          moment
          when the art arises, we do not have enough time and strength to craft it. It would mean to make millions and
          billions of variations. […] Here, you have a slave that follows your wishes. [The computer] allows you to
          materialize very quickly your visual thoughts which you could not have created because of lack of time or
          strength, or visual acuteness.” Working with computation, Molnár pursued a part of the research developed by
          artists like Sol Lewitt, based on conceiving instructions to create a work of art. Giving instructions to the
          machine through code and randomizing some variables, she was, therefore, expanding intuition and enriching her
          senses: “There is a thing that can replace intuition. It’s randomness. Because […] it will show you billions
          of
          possibilities of which, with your limited imagination, you could not have thought of.”
          The concept of expanding the potential of creation, using computers and code, is not limited to this radical
          artistic research. Mirroring the niche of computational art, the graphic design scene of central Europe of the
          1960s developed design research that explored the potential of computation. Karl Gerstner, a prominent figure
          of the Swiss graphic design scene of post-WWII, was one of the first graphic designers who foresaw the
          opportunities brought by computers for a rational and functional graphic design production. In 1963, he
          published Designing Programmes, in which he compiled his efforts for automatizing processes and applying
          scientific methodologies to design. The designer needed a set of rules to select and arrange the different
          design components (typography, images, color). The computer could help create systems that enlarge the range
          of solutions, within which the designer could identify the best one.
          If the work of Gerstner or Molnár was situated at a time when computational machines were essentially
          accessible for scientific or military research, the release of the first Macintosh in 1984 was a pivot towards
          the extension of access to computers for graphic designers, and, in the following years, for a bigger
          audience.
          The American graphic designer April Greiman—who did part of her studies in Basel in the 1970s and was immersed
          in the swiss graphic design approach—was one of the first designers to openly embrace the opportunities
          created by the Macintosh. Interviewed by the magazine Emigre in 1988, she echoed Vera Molnár: “What I
          experience is rather than just doing something quickly, we’re looking at more possibilities. Instead of doing
          more work, we are seeing more options. […] With the Mac, once the information is stored, you can just look at
          seventy-two thousand variations. And then the accidents happen, and you say, ‘Oh that’s so much better, why
          don’t you go that way?’”
          The iteration of graphic results offered by the machine was promoted as a sustainable methodology for design.
          Furthermore, Greiman adopted the esthetical language of the computer as a new opportunity for graphic design
          expression: the pixel, the raster of the screen, transparency and superposition, as well as the simultaneous
          presence of visual elements became core elements of her production. These new esthetics could, according to
          Greiman, empower personal and collective manifestation: “Everybody is visual; it’s in the collective soul, and
          the Mac will empower and help a lot of these people to express themselves. I like the idea that so many people
          will have a common language […] And this tool has its own language!”
          Despite this optimistic vision, we witnessed, starting the mid-1990s, a slow but consistent shift towards a
          different use of the computer. If it was true that in the late 1980s computers were considered tools submitted
          to human beings to expand perception and production, during the following decade this trend faded away. In the
          early 2000s, it resulted in the massification of visual language’s esthetics due to a standardization of the
          tools and, therefore, of the graphic design practice.
          So, what happened between the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 2000s? What were the reasons for the
          shift of the graphic design practice towards standardized methodologies? Radical design research based on the
          exploration of computer depth through the medium of computation was still pursued in institutions such as MIT.
          Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the professional graphic design field was deeply impacted by the rise of the
          “What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get” (WYSIWYG) interfaces that became popular as a way of emancipating oneself from
          the required understanding of the machine to be able to make design, allowing a more intuitive approach to
          graphic composition. Two opposite approaches developed in parallel and drew the main characteristics of what
          this thesis has defined as “start-up and free open source cultures.” In the following sections, we clarify
          their origins and highlight their radical opposition that resulted, at the very beginning of twenty-first
          century, with the birth of Processing.

          <h2>1.1 From Counterculture to Monopoly: A Silicon Valley Story</h2>
          Narrowing down the geographical context in which the technological evolution of the end of the twentieth
          century occurred, we observe that devices and programs massively employed, on a worldwide scale, for graphic
          design production were created in the Silicon Valley. The binomial Apple Computer and Adobe Systems
          intersected in this economic region located in Northern California in the United States. This region, pervaded
          by the “Californian Ideology,” represented the biggest cultural paradox of modern history, and the
          contemporary design’s culture has been molded mirroring this paradox.

          <br><br>

          <p class="quote">The Californian Ideology promiscuously combines the free-wheeling spirit of the hippies and
            the
            entrepreneurial zeal of the yuppies. This amalgamation of opposites has been achieved through a profound
            faith
            in the emancipatory potential of the new information technologies. In the digital utopia, everybody will be
            both hip and rich. Not surprisingly, this optimistic vision of the future has been enthusiastically embraced
            by computer nerds, slacker students, innovative capitalists, social activists, trendy academics, futurist
            bureaucrats and opportunistic politicians across the USA.
          </p>

          <br><br>

          In the transition from the Industrial into the Knowledge Age, cyberspace, the internet, and computers were
          seen as tools for emancipation from the established power and hierarchy. Colonizing this new immaterial
          space
          is an exciting opportunity for freedom and liberation. The Californian counterculture of the 1960s was
          reshaped, during the following decades, into a paradoxical ideology connecting two opposite but equally
          powerful aspirations: the collective adventure enabled by the new reach of global communications and a
          complete professional autonomy thriving on personal success. Marshall McLuhan’s global village theory and
          the
          libertarianism promoted by Ayn Rand’s allegories were hybridized in the start-up culture which, in the name
          of
          innovation, does not perceive, or refuse to admit, the discrepancies of its economic model.
          Between the 1980s and the end of the twentieth century, cyberspace is still a place where market regulations
          are inapplicable or unapplied. Therefore, we witnessed the surge of contrasting visions for the possible
          missions of the internet. The philosophy of the free exchange of knowledge—brought about by activists such
          as
          Aaron Swartz—which fosters openness and collaboration, sets aside the liberal ideal of the conquest of
          cyberspace as a new market, denying any empathy or collaborative spirit, and promoting one’s personal
          success
          at any price.
          The aftermath of this paradoxical conjunction was the advent of start-ups companies born as opponents of
          powerful economic giants that have metamorphosized into giant infrastructures. Apple Computer and Adobe
          Systems—companies hardly avoidable in the professional graphic design field—are striking examples. Both
          corporations initially thriving for innovation with the mission of offering technological autonomy to their
          customers, have progressively been transformed into market dominators, forbidding any emancipation from
          their
          products.


          <h3>1.1.1 Apple Computer</h3>
          Invited by the TV show The Computer Chronicles, “icon designer” Susan Kare and Product Design Manager Jerry
          Manock presented, in 1985, the newly released Apple computer. Ergonomically studied to be light, portable,
          and
          user-friendly, the Macintosh was designed to be used by the “99th percentile of males, females, and
          children,”
          Maddock stated. Developed to allow comprehensive accessibility, the interface system and icons were created
          to
          be clearly and quickly understood and assimilated. Susan Kare shared during the interview that “one of the
          best experiences,” was how to easily teach in roughly twenty minutes to use the Macintosh to those who have
          never used a computer before. This was made possible because the function of each icon does not need
          additional verbal explanation. Interface and object’s ergonomics translated into reality what Steve Jobs
          foresaw few years earlier: “bringing computers to the people, with the cheerful but affordable design of an
          Eichler home and the ease of use of a sleek kitchen appliance.”
          It is paramount to remember that, considering the historical and geographical context in which the Macintosh
          was conceived, its design was inherently western centered. With its focus positioned on the wealthy
          majority,
          Apple partially ignored any inclusive design principle devoted to minorities or “special people,”
          fundamentals
          outlined, a few years later, by Don Norman in his The Design of Everyday Things. Nevertheless,
          “accessibility”
          and “affordability” were at the center of Apple’s communication. The seeds of Apple’s worldwide triumph of
          the
          following decades were grounded in these few concepts, as well as its paradox.
          Describing the interface, Susan Kare highlighted the similarities between Macintosh icons and daily life
          objects: the interface mimicked the interactions with our surroundings. We could easily recognize a
          “document”
          that we organized in a “folder.” If we saw clock hands turning, we could understand that we had to wait for
          time to pass. We calculated simple operations with a pocket calculator, and we put it in the trash can
          documents that we wanted to throw away.

          Since the creation of the personal computer, this intuitive strategy for computer interaction was
          groundbreaking, emancipating users from the need for a deep understanding of inherent machine language. The
          space between the human being and the machine was now inhabited by an interface that functioned as a
          translator. Interface design, thus, became strategic.

          <br><br>
          <p class="quote">The concept [of the interface] lies across a critical boundary—between material and
            immaterial reality. […]
            interface is also the immaterial meeting place between two states of reality, previously extraneous, that
            merge to exchange information, to interact. […] Around the concept of the interface, the relationship
            between
            man and machine calls up the problem of access—man must have access to the machine, and the machine must
            have
            access to the men, in a process that aims at attaining specific objectives.
          </p>
          <br><br>
          The “specific objective” was evidently to facilitate the use of the machine, yet in a consumerist-driven
          effort to conquer a new market. Here resided the paradox: in the trajectory towards innovative accessibility,
          tech corporations have interposed an interface between the human and the machine which, while facilitating
          comprehension of the functions, undermined the user’s personal responsibility of understanding, and learning
          the machine’s language. The result was users’ lack of autonomy, with a consequent submission and dependence on
          technology. The accessibility, presented as a pedagogical gesture to emancipate users from the computer’s
          complexity, resulted instead in their disempowerment. The pedagogical preoccupation was thus solely to educate
          a bigger audience, with the objective of attracting customers.
          Observing the evolution of Apple’s interfaces from its early stages till the beginning of the 2000s, we
          recognize a development towards a skeuomorphic visual language that brought, in parallel, a progressive
          closure of the operating system. Although Apple’s first Macintosh, included a “program to make programs” such
          as HyperCard which allowed its users to actively engage with the computer, this interactivity has become
          increasingly less accessible in newer machines. With the release of macOS X, the customization of graphic
          software through the installation of plug-ins became almost a quest. The fast, powerful, and fancy Apple
          computers of the beginning of the new century almost completely lost their modularity and customizability.
          Despite mimicking a three-dimensional space, their interfaces induced, instead, a linear and flat use of the
          device, preventing any in-depth interaction.

          <h3>1.1.2 Adobe Systems</h3>
          Founded in 1982, Adobe (originally Adobe Systems) has been Apple’s entrepreneurial companion from its early
          stages. From creating the Postscript printing protocol, which allowed Apple to succeed in the desktop
          publishing industry, to developing the early versions of Illustrator for the Macintosh environment only, Adobe
          has been Apple’s wing person in its entrepreneurial journey.
          Adobe’s founders John Warnock and Charles Geschke shared the story and philosophy of the company during its
          twentieth-anniversary celebration in 2002. Grounded in the Silicon Valley ideology, Adobe echoes the
          entrepreneurial vision of the start-up culture. At a time, in the early 1980s, in which the desktop printing
          market—the first territory of their intervention—was not yet defined or understood, Adobe has always thrived
          on innovation, focusing their efforts on groundbreaking products, designed to anticipate trends and market’s
          demands. The advent of the PostScript protocol, Adobe’s first product and precursor of the open and standard
          PDF format, marked a new printing revolution. Bridging the screen and the paper—the “what-you-see” to the
          “what-you-get”—the PostScript language, implemented in the LaserWriter produced by Apple, profoundly reformed
          the graphic design industry, joining the immateriality of the screen to the materiality of the page and
          showing a concrete use of the computer to create graphics that could be converted in a quality tangible
          output.
          During the conference “Adobe Systems: The Founder’s Perspective,” Geschke addressed the two main points of
          Adobe’s philosophy of the time: “Everybody should have their own computer. […] A computer is not primarily
          used to calculate; it’s used to communicate.” Giving access to technology to a wider market remains, as for
          Apple, one of the initial preoccupations of the company. And giving them the opportunity to imagine a
          pragmatic use of the machine computer with the connection to a printer was a breakthrough. Nevertheless, from
          an entrepreneurial standpoint, diversifying their product was critical for the company’s survival.
          In 1986, Adobe released the first version of Adobe illustrator, betting on the new and unlikely graphic design
          field: apart from cutting-edge experimentations of the few, most of the graphic designers had not yet, at the
          time, appropriated and integrated the computer as a production device. Quickly, Adobe Photoshop joined its
          fellow Illustrator and, together, they started conquering designers’ fantasies. Selling the illusion of
          condensing, inside the computer box, and behind the screen, all graphical experimentations previously
          envisioned in the material realm, Adobe designated the computer as the new, compact, mono-tool for the visual
          arts.
          The expansion, during the 1990s, of graphic design programs undeniably empowered for a while the graphic
          design production pushing further the postmodernist experimentations like those initiated by designers such as
          the Swiss Wolfgang Weingart. The binomial computer/software allowed to de-structure, decompose, recompose, and
          reimagine elements (typography, grids, and layout) in newer, faster, easier, unexpected ways, contributing to
          establishing a different temporality for the projects and reforming the design process. The work of designers
          like David Carson, Neville Brody, or Rudy VanderLans, and Zuzana Licko exploited these new frontiers and
          pushed the boundaries of their research focused on hybrid forms on the edge between traditional and
          unconventional design: “We both [VanderLans and Licko], each in our own way, really enjoyed this machine. It
          forced us to question everything we had learnt about design. We both enjoyed that process of exploration, of
          how far you could push the limits.”
          At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the major success of their products led Adobe to progress
          exponentially. Expanding the offer and acquiring competitors’ products and companies, the corporation-to-be
          set a new trajectory for conquering the market—a market they helped define—and assembled an entire armada of
          design programs. These years marked a pivot, shifting Adobe from a dynamic start-up that injected new
          perspectives for the design practice to a colossal infrastructure dominating the graphic design production.
          The visual excitement of the 1990s faded away, replaced by the feeling of being trapped in a conventional and
          expensive “golden cage,” with no possibility of expression out of the standardized path drawn by Adobe’s
          programs and interfaces.
          Over time, Adobe’s interfaces have developed the same inherent structure, offering a global, consistent, and
          comforting environment for their users. Enabled to quickly recognize the graphic setting of the programs and
          easily appropriate the new functionalities, users felt in control of the workflow. However, the comfort of a
          recognizable interface generated a standardization of the esthetics of graphic design productions and a
          conformity in the methodological patters of creation. Employing the same tools, with the same interfaces,
          engendered the harmonization of the mechanical gestures and behaviors during the design process. Furthermore,
          the acceleration of the temporality of production, caused by a hyper-consumerist market, encouraged the
          designers to take advantage of the comfort of Adobe’s environment, and prevented any further design
          exploration of forms or tools.The conformity of design esthetics engendered by the standardization of the
          design tools is critical. However, to better frame the implication of Adobe becoming a monopoly, the question
          of affordability, and thus of accessibility, is crucial. Since the release of the first programs, the cost of
          the products has been prohibitive for most visual artists and designers, rejecting the economic minorities
          from the profession. Being a graphic designer was (and still is) a privilege, as it implies having the
          capacity of buying a computer (Apple) and the programs (Adobe for the most part) needed to create artwork. An
          underground market of cracked software provided, for years, the solution for some designers to start their
          activity until, in 2013, Adobe moved to a subscription-only model, removing any standalone versions. The
          customers are not the owners of the programs they use, and they pay a monthly subscription to access them. If
          the subscription model can be legitimate for commodities such as video on demand, the model becomes
          questionable when applied to professional tools required for working.
          In October 2019, Adobe temporarily blocked the access to Venezuelan customers to their products and enabled
          their customers to access their work on the Creative Cloud. The decision came in conformity with the US
          government’s decision of prohibiting transactions and services between companies of the United States and
          Venezuela and dramatically revealed the flaw of their subscription-only business model. After month of
          negotiations with the US government, Adobe was able to restore the Venezuelan customers’ access to the Cloud.
          Nevertheless, the incident revealed the fragility of designers’ freedom and independence from the Adobe’s
          monopoly, and shown some inconsistencies between the philosophy of the company and its actions:

          <p class="quote">The other philosophy that we have internally […] in the way that our company should operate
            [is based on] one rule: if you are confused [about] how to deal with a fellow employee, a customer, a
            shareholder, or someone out there in the community that you are interfacing with, just treat the individual
            the way you’d like to be treated. […] That would be the Adobe way. Because when you are in business, your
            customers, in many cases, have their business critically dependent on your ability to deliver a quality
            product on time when you promise it. 
          </p>

          <h3>1.1.3 Google Design</h3>
          We have observed how Apple and Adobe contributed to creating and developing the computer and software market
          in the graphic design field. Providing tools which simplified the intellectual access to the computers, they
          have educated, during the years, designers as well as a broader audience, and enabled them to appropriate the
          computer—till that moment seen as a computational machine for calculations—as a tool for communication and
          visual creation. Both Apple and Adobe’s efforts towards accessibility translated into creating environments
          and interfaces that were easy to use and understand. However, the temporary users’ understanding of the
          personal computer’s functions has metamorphosized into a lack of autonomy in front of the ever-changing
          technology. From the middle of the 1980s to the beginning of the 2000s, we witnessed the increase of the
          separation between the user and the computer, which concretized in the standardization of the design
          methodologies caused by the extended offer of programs relying on same interactive patterns.
          Google can be identified as the third actor that heavily contributed to the normalization of graphic design
          esthetics and methodologies. With the release of Google Fonts (originally Google Web Fonts), Google began a
          new business model for tech companies proposing free graphic design components distributed on the internet.
          This gesture towards a sharing strategy that echoes the open source model has democratized the access to
          design yet fostered the commodification of the design culture through the standardization of its esthetics.
          This event was critical in redefining the concept of accessibility. Google Font provided young designers and
          design students an affordable alternative to access, explore, and use typography; yet, it started colonizing
          the graphic design field, with professionals and agencies taking advantage of the easy-to-use and free offer,
          forgoing the singularity and uniqueness that typographers used to bring to each design project. In January
          2019, the branding agency Carré Noir redesigned the city of Paris’ logo and identity, using the font
          Montserrat as its main typeface—one of Google Font’s best sellers.
          Is this business model a simple gesture to emancipate the users? The paradox of innovation of the start-up
          culture is still current. The shift toward a more open business model seems to benefit the tech corporation
          that, in providing commodities, retains its customers in its comforting cybercommunity. The complexity of
          defining “accessibility” is critical. Does Google’s “accessibility” mean providing access to products or
          providing tools for autonomy? Is accessibility equal to emancipation, or just another way to conquer the
          market?
          In 2015, Google released Material Design, a comprehensive catalog of design components to create interactive
          applications, and published the documentation and specs online as an open platform. Material Design was
          thought to give consistency to the interactive interfaces of Android products (Apple’s competitor). Giving
          open access to design tools with the mission of providing accessibility to a better design seemed innovative
          and far-sighted. If we watch the teaser Making Material Design published online for the release, we can
          identify some keywords such as “collaboration,” “community,” “experiment” that are repositioning the
          philosophy of Google towards a place close to the free open source approach.
          The proposition is appealing. Nevertheless, the main consequences of Google’s proposition are the esthetical
          uniformity of interaction design products’, and the weakening of designers’ legitimacy as professional
          experts. Presenting the color palettes of Material Design, Google’s Senior Designer Rachel Been stated:
          “[with] this really simplified and easy-to-use system, […] someone who never took a color theory class could
          create a combination of colors within their products that felt harmonious.”
          Google has drastically contributed to the commodification of design practice and culture, fostering an ideal
          of “universal design” open to everyone, for everyone, by everyone, dramatically undermining the importance of
          designing with a focus on singularities. Matias Duarte, Vice-President of Material Design, reiterated their
          ideal of proposing principles of design that “should be timeless” in order to achieve a universal framework.
          The concepts of universality and accessibility are, thus, central to this thesis’ investigations.
          For years, the free open source culture’s communities have pursued a parallel path, observing the development
          of the tech giants and, sometimes, raising their voice to expose the injustices created by the new hierarchies
          they have put into place. Processing’s community has contributed the most to a critical approach to design
          aimed to empower the user instead of having them be submitted to a passive stance. Before diving into
          Processing’s story, the next section will retrace the path of the free open source culture and communities
          situating them historically and geographically.

          <h1>1.2 From Hackers to FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software): A Moral Debate</h1>
        </div>

        <div class="twoCol">
          For years in the shadow, often misunderstood and stigmatized, the legacy inherited from programmers and
          software developers has tremendously influenced the approach fostered by the Processing community. Between the
          1960s and the 2000s, hacking, free software, and open source grew in parallel with the start-up culture,
          countering the capitalistic and consumer-driven orientation that was colonizing the field of software
          development at the time. Despite the fact that hackers and open source methodologies are now actively
          inspiring the contemporary design fields, the terminology referring to those cultures is often misused or,
          worse, misunderstood.
          To better frame the meaning of “free open source culture” employed in this research, this section analyzes
          some of the central texts that modeled the cultures of hackers, free software, and open source, and clarifies
          their terminology. Through the following literature review, this research retraces the path connecting the
          hackers’ ethics rooted in the MIT of the 1950s, through the open source methodology established in the late
          1990s, till the contemporary definition of FLOSS (Free/Libre Open Source Software), and continues further to
          reveal the sour debate about the ethics of software development and distribution, that emerged at the end of
          the last century.
